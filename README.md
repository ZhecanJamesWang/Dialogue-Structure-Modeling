# Dialogue-Structure-Modeling
Natural Language Processing Research on Social Media Data

This computational linguistic research project aims to match multiple questions and answers in conversation.

For example:

If we have a chating log between person A and person B like this:

```
A: When are you coming back?

A: Do you want to do dinner together.

                              Let's do dinner together. :B

                              I will be back in half an hour. :B
```

In this case, we want to match the first answer to the second question and the second answer to the first question. 

While this example is very simple, this project can be quite uesful in collaborate environment, like a group chat, or searching.
